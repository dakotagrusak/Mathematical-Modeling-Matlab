# Mathematical Modeling with MATLAB
Work from Mathematical Modeling at Trinity University in Fall 2018

## HW1
#### 1. Conditional Statements

Write a program that accepts a numerical variable **x** from 0 to 100 and displays the corresponding letter grade give by the table below

| Letter Grade | Score Range |
|---|--------|
| A | 90-100 |
| B | 80-89  |
| C | 70-79  |
| D | 60-69  |
| F | <= 59  |

#### 2. Loop Control Statements
Find how long it will take to accumulate at least $10,000 in a bank account if you deposit $500 initially and $500 at the end of each year, if the account pays 10% annual interest.

#### 3. Least Squares Regression
To determine which function base (e or 2) is a better function to approximate the rabbit population (generated from the Fibonacci sequence), **implement percent errors to determine which base returns a closer approximation to the actual rabbit population at month 21**. Include your implementation in the code downloaded from Tlearn and use comments to justify your answers.

- percentError(base_e, fib)

- percentError(base_2, fib)
